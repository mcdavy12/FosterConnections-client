# FosterConnections
Red Badge project for ElevenFifty Academy

Description
The FosterConnections app is a resource for foster parents and the professional staff who educate foster parents on providing the best possible care to their foster children.  The first iteration of the application allows for staff to create trainings and foster parents to register.  Future iterations will allow staff the ability to add skills associated with each training and adding those skills to the foster parents profile.  This will allow the staff the ability to search for foster parents based on skills.

Installation
FosterConnections is a reactjs application best used with the latest Google Chrome browser.

Roadmap
Future releases include: Adding skills to the training classes.  Showing all foster parents who have registered for a traiing class.  Adding links to online training opportunities.  Adding ability to mark when a foster parent has completed a training.  Admin ability to search for foster parents based on skills they've gained.

Contributing
At this time I am not accepting contributations.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.
