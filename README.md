# FosterConnections
Red Badge project for ElevenFifty Academy


The FosterConnections app is a resource for foster parents and the professional staff who educate foster parents on providing the best possible care to their foster children.  The first iteration of the application allows for staff to create trainings and foster parents to register.  Future iterations will allow staff the ability to add skills associated with each training and adding those skills to the foster parents profile.  This will allow the staff the ability to search for foster parents based on skills.


FosterConnections is a reactjs application best used with the latest Google Chrome browser.

Future releases include: Adding skills to the training classes.  Showing all foster parents who have registered for a traiing class.  Adding links to online training opportunities.  Adding ability to mark when a foster parent has completed a training.  Admin ability to search for foster parents based on skills they've gained.


At this time I am not accepting contributations.


I would like to thank the Eleven Fifty Academy, specifically Eli Drumm, for all of his support and mentoring in the creation of this project.  


The project is currently active and being updated daily.
